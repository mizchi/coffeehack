      <h1>coffeehack</h1>
      coffeehack is one of a few thousand rogue like games that are out here on the web.
      The "coffee" part of "coffeehack" is given after the name of the programming language used to write this game,
      and the "hack" part came from the authors favourite rogue-like game "nethack".
      The game itself has nothing to do with coffee nor hacking.
      The theme of this game is the ninjitsus which ninjas use. 
      The main aim of the game currently is to use ninjitsus wisely to defeat the enemies and go down as deep as you can.
      <h1>key-bindings</h1>
      coffeehack's key-bindings are more or less similar to those of nethack.
      <table>
        <tr><td>h</td><td>move left</td></tr>
        <tr><td>j</td><td>move backward</td></tr>
        <tr><td>k</td><td>move upward</td></tr>
        <tr><td>l</td><td>move right</td></tr>
        <tr><td>&gt;</td><td>go down</td><td>Only valid when you are on a downward staircase cell</td></tr>
        <tr><td>&lt;</td><td>go up</td><td>Only valid when you are on a upward staircase cell</td></tr>
        <tr><td>y</td><td>answer yes to a question</td></tr>
        <tr><td>anything else</td><td>rest on the current cell</td></tr>
      </table>
      <h1>ninjitsu</h1>
      There are special cells on the map which are shown as an "*" character (if you are playing the text-mode).
      When you are on that cell, you can use one of many ninjitsus that helps you defeating the monsters.
      A message should appear in the message area at the top asking you if you wanna use that jitsu or not.
      If you do, you press "y" key otherwise press any key other than "y".
