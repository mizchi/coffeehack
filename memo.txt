*MMORPG
user - user, client - server model
user - user, peer 2 peer model
central server - multi user, server - client model

**central server
has fixed maps
handles new connections #HEAVY
handles the key strokes and message passing
do not render the whole map each time a user move. 
instead just send the changed coordinates

**consideration
can they kill each other #YES
what is used to identify a player #SESSION
how to send messages back and forth between browser and server #WEB SOCKETS





OOP considerations

Should the player have the method to increment his HP on each turn?
or the game class having it is totally ok?
