coffeehack
      coffeehack is one of meny rogue like games that are out there on the web.
      The "coffee" part of "coffeehack" is given after the name of the programming language used to write this game,
      and the "hack" part came from the authors favourite rogue-like game "nethack".
      The game itself has nothing to do with coffee nor hacking.
      The theme of this game is the ninjitsus which ninjas use. 
      The main aim of the game currently is to use ninjitsus wisely to defeat the enemies and go down as deep as you can.

features
      coffeehack is single player game. You walk around on the map as the player using the classich, j, k, l keys
      There is a plan of making it MMO, if interested, checkout coffeehack-mmo repository.

      coffeehack currently doesn't have items because of its suspected difficulty of implementation.
      Instead it has a special cells set up that perform similar roles to what items do.
      They are called "ninjitsu filed"s. When you walk onto it, a message will appear at the message line at the top
      asking if you'd like to cast that spell or not. A ninjitsu is much like a magic and most of them are designed to help you.
      It might be possible that ninjitsus will be replaced by the traitional item system.      

      coffeehack implements the same fighting system as many rogue-likes, meaning that it doesn't have a fighting mode.
      You simply walk into the enemy, and the attack happens.

      The game has many parameters you should be aware of. All of them are displayed in the status lines
      at the bottom of the screen. The most important one is the HP (hit points). You will gain some HPs when your
      experience level goes up. If you lose them all you'll die. coffeehack is yet to manage the stomuch emptyness but is
      prioritized highly.
